GCCM 1.1: Introduce a CO2 emission of 5 Gt C in the year 1900 and 0 Gt C otherwise.
i.Use the Euler forward time integration scheme and find a steady state of the model. Use the steady state as undisturbed initial conditions.
ii.Introduce a CO2 emission of 5Gt C in the year 1900 and 0 Gt in other years. Calculate the change in the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere for 1900 â€“ 2000 and the concentration difference between the disturbed and the reference (pre-industrial) concentration.

GCCM 1.2: Time step dependency.
i.Calculate the atmospheric concentration in dependence of the year for different time steps dt = {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4,6,8} years. .
